<h1>Chat aplication template with Chat Bot</h1>

<h2>Informations:</h2>
I present to you my first post on my github. This is a template that the user can deploy on any website.<br>
The application contains a config that the user can configure as desired. The application was created using React and NodeJS technologies, it only supports MongoDB so far.<br>
You can find a sample application to try at <a href="#chat-aplication-tempalte-with-chat-bot">this link</a>.<br>

> [!WARNING]
> <strong>The code cannot be further modified without the consent of the owner.</strong> Only config.js and env files.<br>

If you have any questions, feel free to write to my email or discord. I wish you a great use :yum:.<br>
