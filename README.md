<h1>Chat aplication template with Chat Bot</h1>

<h2>Informations:</h2>
<p>I present to you my first post on my github. This is a template that the user can deploy on any website.</p>
<p>The application contains a config that the user can configure as desired. The application was created using React and NodeJS technologies, it only supports <strong>MongoDB</strong> so far.</p>
